# Vanilla js SPA

- It was a challenge for creating Single Page App using only vanilla js without any framework.

- It is a simple web site to send and receive Happy New Year's messages. 

- I used only vanilla js in this project(even no webpack, no express).

- It is more suitable for mobile than web browser.

- You can use it just by downloading and running it through the vs code(live server)

- It is using Rest API provided by the host of the chllenge. The providing is not permanent. 

- User can post messages including title, content and image, but the image is randomly and automatically choosen when user click the post-button.
